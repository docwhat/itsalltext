# It's All Text!

*It's All Text!* is an addon for Firefox.  It will, with version 2.0, be available for all browsers.

Ever had to type text into an edit box on some web page?  If it was longer than one sentence, then you need *It's All Text!*

This miracle extension provides an edit button for any edit box (AKA `textarea`) on any page or your money back (I have an abundance of nothing to give you)!

After installing *It's All Text* you'll see a little "edit" button next to each edit box. Click it. If this is the first time you've used *It's All Text!* then you will be asked to set your preferences; the most important one is your editor.

The text from the edit box will pop up in your selected editor. When you save it, it'll refresh in the web page. Wait for the magic yellow glow that means that the radiation has taken effect!

Remember, with great power outages come great responsibility outages.

# FAQ

## How do I do something more complicated than just running an editor with a file-name?

In UNIX systems, such as Mac OS X or Linux, you can create a shell script with your commands in it. You then set the preferences to launch this script.

Example:

    #!/bin/bash
    set -eu
    exec /usr/bin/myfavoriteditor --option "$@"

In Microsoft Windows, you can create a .cmd script instead. Again, you set your preferences to launch this .cmd script.

An example for [JEdit](http://www.jedit.org/) in Windows:

    @echo off
    
    C:\WINDOWS\system32\javaw.exe -Xms64M -Xmx192M -jar "C:\www\jEdit\jedit.jar" -reuseview %1

## Where is the edit button for (gmail, blogger, etc.)?

Gmail, blogger, and other sites has the option to use "rich text editors". The editors act similar to a word processor. Due to the way these work, it isn't possible for *It's All Text!* find the `textarea`, it is hidden or, in some cases, absent.

**Workaround:** Turn off the rich text editor, if possible.

## Why do my non-ASCII characters turn into blocks or question marks?

The problem is that the encoding *It's All Text!* is using and your editor is using don't match. You can figure out what encoding your editor wants and change the encodings preference in *It's All Text!* or you can change the encoding your editor uses.

In Microsoft Windows, a common problem I get is that someone is using Notepad or WordPad. These both have lousy support for encode. I recommend getting something like  [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/) for editing in UTF-8 instead.

## I'm having trouble with Mac OS X...help?

Out of the box, *It's All Text!* uses the `open` program. open behaves like double clicking on a file. It uses the type of the file to choose the correct application to run; for `.txt` files, that application is the built-in text editor. If this behavior is fine for you, then leave the editor option alone and enjoy! However, if you want to use a different editor or to force the same editor regardless of the file type, then you will need to do something a little more complicated. Firefox cannot run `.app` applications directly.

To run a `.app` program in Mac OS X you need to do one of three things:

* With some editors installed as .apps the editor is a mach-o binary in the .app (which itself is just a directory), using the path of the binary may launch the editor entirely.
* If your editor comes with a non-.app version, then use that.
* Otherwise you have to write a shell script.

Check the .app directory through the Terminal, it will contain a Contents directory.  In the Contents directory is a MacOS directory.  In the MacOS directory there will be one or more executable binaries to launch your editor.

For example, the .app for Emacs 24 contains the following binaries:

`/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.4`
`/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.7`

Emacs-10.4 is a universal binary for use on any OS X system (including PPC), as the filename indicates it is for OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and above.  The Emacs-10.7 file is a 64-bit binary for OS X 10.7 (Lion) and above.  Use the file command to determine what type of binary your editor has been compiled as, like so:

    bash-3.2$ file /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.4
    /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.4: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures
    /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.4 (for architecture x86_64): Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
    /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.4 (for architecture i386): Mach-O executable i386
    /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.4 (for architecture ppc): Mach-O executable ppc
    bash-3.2$ file /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.7
    /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-10.7: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
    bash-3.2$ 

This has been successfully tested with OS X 10.5 (Leopard) using Emacs 22 and with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and Emacs 24, many versions of Firefox and several versions of Seamonkey over several years.  It should operate in a similar manner for other editors, but extensive testing has not yet been performed.

Check your editor's documentation.

 if it comes with a standalone program, usually located in the `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin` directory, then you can enter that into the *It's All Text!* preferences and you're done.

Otherwise, you need to create a shell script. Here are the basic steps to create a shell script:

1. Open your favorite editor.
2. Create a file like the example below.
3. Save it to your home directory: ~/iat.sh
4. Open a terminal window.
5. Type this command to make the shell script executable: chmod +x ~/iat.sh
6. In *It's All Text!* preferences, use the shell script as your editor.

The example shell script: Replace `/Applications/TextEdit.app` with the actual path to your `.app` file. It'll probably be something like `/Applications/MyEditor.app`.

    #!/bin/sh
    # This is an example shell script for It's All Text!
    
    if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
      touch "$1"
    fi
    
    # Remove quarantine bit that may get set for extensions MacOSX doesn't
    # recognize, and that may cause an unneeded security dialog to appear. (We
    # *know* there are no viruses on this file, 'cause we just created it)
    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "$1" 
    
    exec /usr/bin/open -a Vim "$1"
    #EOF

# Version 2.0

Version 2.0 will work on a completely different mechanism which will allow it work across Chrome, Firefox, and any other browser that has plugins that do ajax requests.

I'm currently working on that over in my [iated](http://github.com/docwhat/iated/) project.
